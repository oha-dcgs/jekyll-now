    <td>This lesson was a new beginning after a long break, so it was quite strange getting back into it, but work was done. Starting is always the hardest part. Not knowing where to start, where to make the first crack in the iceberg that is a new task. So the important thing is outlining how to do what you are going to what and what it is?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As i mentioned earlier, the hardest part of a project is starting. Working out what you have to do. THis was the my biggest struggle, this was my biggest task this lesson. Breaking the metaphorical ice. Unfortunately I only started on one of the 3 projects that we have to do, so this problem won't go away for a while.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>

  <tr>
    <td>Next i need to be faster in getting going, and not wasting time stressing and just getting in a loop of unhelpful thinking. It's a large barrier for a large project, and is to be expected, and it is definitely something I need to work on. THat is my main goal right now, they say acknowledging a problem is the first stage to fixing it, so I guess this is a good start.</td>
