    <td>This lesson i made sure to keep a good balance between talking to people and getting work done. I always made sure that work took the forefront, but that does not mean that I did not hunker down and talk to no one. I had to make sure to take constructive criticism and input from people around me. Although I made sure that none of it was from Max. Who was sitting next to me at the time. </td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>In this lesson the balance that I made was almost perfect. But not quite. I think I didn't pay attention to my peers. I could have gotten so much further, but I refused some of the input that my fellow students had to offer. Some of it I was right to ignore, some of it I should not have.</td>

  <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>

    <td>Next time I will come in with this mantra, "Always listen to what others have to offer". With this hopefully I will be able to progress faster and better with the help of my peers and Massi.</td>
