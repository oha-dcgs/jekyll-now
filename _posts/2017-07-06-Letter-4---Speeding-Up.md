    <td>This week I made sure that I was not too chatty. Making sure that you're not just talking with you friends instead of talking proactively about the subject you are working on. This was a predominant point in last week's blog, but the point still stands. It is always important to make sure you are staying on track.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson the main thing that was getting in my way was myself, for example, I would be working on my blog, but flat out donâ€™t have the knowledge to fix what I have done. I should have called for help much earlier than I did. If I had I could have gotten so much more done in the lesson than what I did.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure not to be too closed minded, or to act to closed. If I need help, I should call for help, that sort of thing. There is a use to chatting often, as long as you make sure it does not get out of hand. You should be making constructive criticism about each other's work and how they can improve, not joking about the latest episode of Love Island.</td>
