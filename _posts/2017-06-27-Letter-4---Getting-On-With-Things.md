    <td>In the lesson I worked quickly and effectively, I made sure to not get too distracted, and made sure I was always on task. This allowed me to progress faster with the task given and also allowed me to have time to review what I had done before I had to hand it in. I think this allowed me to give a better finished product, due to my better workflow.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson not a lot limited my learning. However, I think, despite my speed, I could have been better. For example, something I could have done is not ignore the people around like I did last time. Their input is often useful, and when I have a problem I could ask for their help if I need help.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time I will make sure to take the input of others into consideration when encountering a problem. For example, should I come to a crossroads. Let's say I fall down on my knee. I will take in the consideration of other people about how I well get up from the situation. That is important to me.</td>
