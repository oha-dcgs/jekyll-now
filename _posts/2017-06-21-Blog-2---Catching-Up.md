    <td>When catching up, you have to make sure to get everything. If you miss something, then you won't learn as well as others. Don’t just text your mate 16 hours before the lesson asking if there was anything from IT that wasn’t the blog. That is just going to hinder you in the future. You need to make sure that you set up connections from which you can get the missed work (in other words have friends (something I have been known to struggle with but let’s ignore that)).</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was of course not being in the lesson, but other than that, the fact that I could not catch up until early monday because of how I was feeling. Through the weekend I still felt bad and didn’t want to overwork myself (I have done this previously).</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try my hardest to not get ill (yet again something I have been known to struggle with) and to have friends so that I can find out about the homework faster and with more accuracy. This is essential. For anyone. Besides the fact you need a social life to maintain a healthy mind, (yet again something I learned the hard way) you also just need to be good at knowing what is what in terms of what you missed. You would think that will all of the school I have missed I would be better at catching up.</td>
