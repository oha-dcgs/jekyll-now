    <td>Dearest reader, I am writing to you during the depths of the early July heat to inform you that this will be my last instalment of the blog. It pains me to say it. Over the time that I had to enjoy the responsibility of this blog I have learned a lot. I have learned to not just code, but also to balance working and playing, and how to make sure that what I do is of the highest quality possible.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>I must admit over my time with the blog, that I have struggled to format it, and make it look visually pleasing. This is one of my greatest regrets. I will never forgive myself for what I have done. I must try to come to terms with it, but I know it will be difficult. I have lost the talent that I had while making my first blog, and now I understand what I have missed. The finesse that is required is simply something I do not have anymore. I will definitely make it a priority to work on this, using w3schools and other resources to make sure next time I am at the top of my game.</th>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Next time, I will make formatting and colouring of my bog a top priority, and not dilly dally around in other projects in repl.it and such before properly sorting out my bog. I need priorities. Next time I must make a list of what is required of me. Not just 'wing it' along the way, in doing this I lose quality and the shine that I require when making a project. This, dear reader, is my final goodbye. Farewell.</th>
